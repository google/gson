# Gson

Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.
Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.

There are a few open-source projects that can convert Java objects to JSON. However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in your classes; something that you can not do if you do not have access to the source-code. Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics. Gson considers both of these as very important design goals.

> [!NOTE]\
> Gson is currently in maintenance mode; existing bugs will be fixed, but large new features will likely not be added. If you want to add a new feature, please first search for existing GitHub issues, or create a new one to discuss the feature and get feedback.

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> Gson's main focus is on Java. Using it with other JVM languages such as Kotlin or Scala might work fine in many cases, but language-specific features such as Kotlin's non-`null` types or constructors with default arguments are not supported. This can lead to confusing and incorrect behavior.\
> When using languages other than Java, prefer a JSON library with explicit support for that language.

### Goals
  * Provide simple `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa
  * Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON
  * Extensive support of Java Generics
  * Allow custom representations for objects
  * Support arbitrarily complex objects (with deep inheritance hierarchies and extensive use of generic types)

### Download

Gradle:
```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.11.0'
}
```

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
  <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
  <version>2.11.0</version>
</dependency>
```

[Gson jar downloads](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.google.code.gson/gson) are available from Maven Central.

![Build Status](https://github.com/google/gson/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

### Requirements
#### Minimum Java version
- Gson 2.12.0 and newer: Java 8
- Gson 2.9.0 to 2.11.0: Java 7
- Gson 2.8.9 and older: Java 6

Despite supporting older Java versions, Gson also provides a JPMS module descriptor (module name `com.google.gson`) for users of Java 9 or newer.

#### JPMS dependencies (Java 9+)
These are the optional Java Platform Module System (JPMS) JDK modules which Gson depends on.
This only applies when running Java 9 or newer.

- `java.sql` (optional since Gson 2.8.9)\
When this module is present, Gson provides default adapters for some SQL date and time classes.

- `jdk.unsupported`, respectively class `sun.misc.Unsafe` (optional)\
When this module is present, Gson can use the `Unsafe` class to create instances of classes without no-args constructor.
However, care should be taken when relying on this. `Unsafe` is not available in all environments and its usage has some pitfalls,
see [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()).

#### Minimum Android API level

- Gson 2.11.0 and newer: API level 21
- Gson 2.10.1 and older: API level 19

Older Gson versions may also support lower API levels, however this has not been verified.

### Building

Gson uses Maven to build the project:
```
mvn clean verify
```

JDK 11 or newer is required for building, JDK 17 or 21 is recommended. Newer JDKs are currently not supported for building (but are supported when _using_ Gson).
