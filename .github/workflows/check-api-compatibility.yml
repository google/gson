    # This setup tries to determine API incompatibility only for the changes introduced by the
    # pull request. It does this by first checking out the 'old' version and installing it into
    # the local Maven repository before then using japicmp to compare it to the current changes.
    #
    # Alternatively it would also be possible to compare against the last release version instead.
    #
    # Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, see description of
    # https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2692 for details.
