### Checklist
<!-- The following checklist is mainly intended for yourself to verify that you did not miss anything -->

- [ ] New code follows the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)\
  This is automatically checked by `mvn verify`, but can also be checked on its own using `mvn spotless:check`.\
  Style violations can be fixed using `mvn spotless:apply`; this can be done in a separate commit to verify that it did not cause undesired changes.
- [ ] If necessary, new public API validates arguments, for example rejects `null`
- [ ] New public API has Javadoc
    - [ ] Javadoc uses `@since $next-version$`  
      (`$next-version$` is a special placeholder which is automatically replaced during release)
- [ ] If necessary, new unit tests have been added  
  - [ ] Assertions in unit tests use [Truth](https://truth.dev/), see existing tests
  - [ ] No JUnit 3 features are used (such as extending class `TestCase`)
  - [ ] If this pull request fixes a bug, a new test was added for a situation which failed previously and is now fixed
- [ ] `mvn clean verify javadoc:jar` passes without errors
