/**
 * An annotation that indicates this member should be exposed for JSON serialization or
 * deserialization.
 *
 * <p>This annotation has no effect unless you build {@link com.google.gson.Gson} with a {@link
 * com.google.gson.GsonBuilder} and invoke {@link
 * com.google.gson.GsonBuilder#excludeFieldsWithoutExposeAnnotation()} method.
 *
 * <p>Here is an example of how this annotation is meant to be used:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class User {
 *   &#64;Expose private String firstName;
 *   &#64;Expose(serialize = false) private String lastName;
 *   &#64;Expose (serialize = false, deserialize = false) private String emailAddress;
 *   private String password;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If you created Gson with {@code new Gson()}, the {@code toJson()} and {@code fromJson()} methods
 * will use the {@code password} field along-with {@code firstName}, {@code lastName}, and {@code
 * emailAddress} for serialization and deserialization. However, if you created Gson with {@code
 * Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().excludeFieldsWithoutExposeAnnotation().create()} then the {@code
 * toJson()} and {@code fromJson()} methods of Gson will exclude the {@code password} field. This is
 * because the {@code password} field is not marked with the {@code @Expose} annotation. Gson will
 * also exclude {@code lastName} and {@code emailAddress} from serialization since {@code serialize}
 * is set to {@code false}. Similarly, Gson will exclude {@code emailAddress} from deserialization
 * since {@code deserialize} is set to false.
 *
 * <p>Note that another way to achieve the same effect would have been to just mark the {@code
 * password} field as {@code transient}, and Gson would have excluded it even with default settings.
 * The {@code @Expose} annotation is useful in a style of programming where you want to explicitly
 * specify all fields that should get considered for serialization or deserialization.
